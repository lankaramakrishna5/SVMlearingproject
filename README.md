# SVMlearingproject

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a particle collision event is classified as a signal (Higgs boson) or background. The HIGGS dataset, which is large-scale and high-dimensional, requires efficient data handling, advanced feature selection, and model tuning.

All files required for this project, including code, data, and supporting documents such as `requirements.txt`, are provided in the files section. For the detailed problem statement, please refer to **Part A** of the assignment PDF located in the files folder.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: HIGGS Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS)
- **Features**: 28 physics-derived features from particle collision events
- **Target**: Binary classification (Signal vs. Background)

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**

   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and identify outliers.
   - Apply data normalization or standardization for optimal model performance.
   - Conduct feature engineering and selection using methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and SelectKBest.

2. **Linear SVM Implementation**

   - Train and evaluate an SVM with a linear kernel using cross-validation.
   - Report classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
   - Discuss strategies for handling the large-scale dataset (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent or mini-batch learning).

3. **SVM with Polynomial, RBF, and Custom Kernels**

   - Train and evaluate SVMs with Polynomial (degree 2, 3, 4), RBF, and custom kernels.
   - Tune regularization parameter \( C \) for each kernel and compare performance based on classification metrics and computational complexity.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

   - Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization and Random Search.
   - Analyze hyperparameter sensitivity and visualize the results.

5. **Analysis and Report**
   - Summarize results across all kernel methods, discussing the most suitable approach based on performance and computational efficiency.
   - Use SHAP or LIME for model interpretability, highlighting influential features.
